    "title": "CSS Grid vs Flexbox",
    "excerpt": "Understanding when to use CSS Grid and when to use Flexbox for layout.",
    "content": "Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they serve different purposes. Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts where you need to control both rows and columns. It's ideal for complex page layouts, card grids, and any situation where you need precise control over positioning. Flexbox, on the other hand, excels at one-dimensional layouts - either rows or columns. It's perfect for navigation bars, centering content, and distributing space within a container. The key is to understand that they work together: use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for the components within those grid areas. This approach gives you the best of both worlds and creates more maintainable, flexible designs.",

    "excerpt": "Modern JavaScript features that every developer should know.",
    "content": "ES6 introduced many powerful features to JavaScript including arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and more. Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind the 'this' context. Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays and objects into distinct variables, making code more readable and efficient. Template literals use backticks and allow for multi-line strings and variable interpolation. Other important features include let and const for block-scoped variables, classes for object-oriented programming, modules for code organization, and promises for handling asynchronous operations. These features have become essential for modern JavaScript development and are widely supported across all major browsers.",

    "content": "Responsive design is crucial in today's multi-device world. Learn how to create flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. The key principles include mobile-first design, flexible grid systems, and responsive images. Start by designing for mobile devices and progressively enhance for larger screens. Use relative units like percentages and ems instead of fixed pixels. Implement flexible images that scale with their containers. CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on device characteristics. Consider touch targets for mobile users and ensure text remains readable at all sizes. Test your designs on actual devices and use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes. Remember that responsive design is not just about screen size - it's about creating the best possible experience for every user.",

    "content": "Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server, opening up new possibilities for full-stack development. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that's perfect for building scalable network applications. You can use the same language (JavaScript) for both frontend and backend development, which simplifies the development process and allows for code sharing. Node.js comes with npm, the world's largest software registry, giving you access to thousands of packages. Popular frameworks like Express.js make it easy to build web servers and APIs. The event loop handles asynchronous operations efficiently, making Node.js particularly good for real-time applications, APIs, and microservices. Whether you're building a simple web server or a complex application, Node.js provides the tools and ecosystem you need.",
